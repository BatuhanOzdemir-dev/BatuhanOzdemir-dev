### Hello now, I'm Batuhan! 👋

👨‍💻 In games I usually go with the name 'Viellyn'. 

🎮 I've been creating games for over 4 years! 

🎓 Recently I've completed all my classes for my Undergraduate study at Uludağ University. 

💼 As of then I've been looking for an internship on Game Dev or AI. 

🤖 Currently having completed my thesis on power-line classification with VGG19, I keep learning about Deep Learning!

🤔 As such, I'd love any help or advice on getting better on this field.

🎧 Fun fact: I'm really into mad music like Hard Rock & Power Metal!

☕️ And I love my Coffee made of half-milk-half-water, with sugar of course.
