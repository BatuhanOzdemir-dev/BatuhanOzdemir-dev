### Hello now, I'm Batuhan! 👋

👨‍💻 In games I usually go with the name 'Viellyn'.
Although you may see me as Chill Goril as well.

🎮 I've been creating games for well over 4 years!
Most of it has been solely for fun of it & not focusing on a certain field or engine,
Yet for the last year I've been working on Unity.

🎓 Recently I've completed all my classes for my Undergraduate study at Uludağ University. 
During this time I learned about all sides of programming & development.
I focused my time on Game Development & Mobile and Web Development using JavaScript.

💼 As of then I've been looking for an internship on Unity Game or Mobile App & Web development!
Both of these fields are really fun to work on for me. I'm planning to keep going on both sides professionally.
If one of them shows up as a job opportunity, the other will be my full-time hobby!

🤖 Currently having completed my thesis on power-line classification with VGG19, I keep learning about Deep Learning!
Yes, I'm trying to get into the field of AI. Though I'm not sure how exactly to "focus" on it, I'll keep on trying.
More specifically, after I can get my internship done and graduate, I plan to focus on this field for my Master's Degree.

🤔 I'd love any help on finding an internship or any advice on getting better at Game Dev!

🎧 Fun fact: I'm really into mad music like Hard Rock & Power Metal!

☕️ And I love my Coffee made of half-milk-half-water, with sugar of course.
